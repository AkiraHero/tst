# ModelSimulator

## Introduction

Simulator is an popular method to develop autonomous driving system. With the help of synthesized scenes, infinite data can be generated for system validation. In addition to the traditional basic factors in simulator such as environments and sensors, the deep models used in perception are playing an increasingly important role. 

Here we want to explore the behavior of deep models, and find a solution to simulate their output. Therefore, the demand on data simulation can be decreased, and the information embedded in existing data can be maximize utilized.



## Developing Instruction

Any incremental coding should be added to newly created branch, and wait for merge into master when pass test.
